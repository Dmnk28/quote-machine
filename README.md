# Random Poems - Quote Machine
A kind of quote machine made with React and Material UI.
Instead of simple quotes you will learn about Arabic and Persian Poetry, and there are some German Poems as well.

## The Collection
The Poems are chosen to illustrate the influences medieval oriental poetry had on Poets like Goethe and so on. Since there are now only a few poems stored now, I will constantly add one or two poems that fit the criteria. 


## Features
1. Please take note of the Translate-Button, if your classical Arabic or medieval Farsi is not in best shape nowadays. The Button will provide you a German translation which will be another translators work (sometimes checked over by me) or my very own (corrections always welcome). 
1. Feel free to tweet your favorite random poem in Arabic/Persian/German. 

### Features to be implemented:
- Wikilinks to the Poets and other Translators
- Rendering the Dates of Death (Poets)
- Build a "show all Poems"-Page, where they can be filtered and the visible selection printed to
    - the Arabic / Persian original Texts should always be printed/displayed so the feeling will be there for everyone, including users only searching for a German translation  


### Bugs to Fix
- Tweeting Poem 1 in Arabic isn't working. Seems to be a Typo or a RTL-LTR-problem in this specific dataset only. It will be solved when the next Poem-data is added.
    - Other arabic poems and the Translation of Poem 1 are working fine. Quick check in Developertools didn't help... Maybe trying to enter it again.

## Project-URL:
You theoretically would find the project in the wild on my [webpage](https://do-webdev.de/), which is under construction at the moment. 
But the Poems are already reachable: [https://do-webdev.de/projects/poems/](https://do-webdev.de/projects/poems/).
