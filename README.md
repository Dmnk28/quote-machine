# Random Poems - Quote Machine
A kind of quote machine made with React and Material UI
Instead of simple quotes you will learn about Arabic and Persian Poetry, and some German as well.

## The Collection
The Poems are chosen to illustrate the influences medieval oriental poetry had on Poets like Goethe and so on. Since there are now only a few poems stored now, I will constantly add one or two poems that fit the criteria. 

## Features
Please take note of the Translate-Button, if your classical Arabic or medieval Farsi is not in best shape nowadays. Then you will get an German Translation which will be another translators work (sometimes checked over by me) or my own (corrections always welcome). 

Feel free to tweet your favorite random poem in Arabic/Persian/German. 

### Features to be implemented:
- Wikilinks to the Poets and other Translators
- Rendering the Dates of Death (Poets)
- Build a "show all Poems"-Page, where they can be filtered and the visible selection printed to
    - the Arabic / Persian original Texts should always be printed/displayed so the feeling will be there for everyone, including users only searching for a German translation  

## Project-URL:
You can find the project in the wild on my [webpage](https://do-webdev.de/), which might be under construction. 
But the Poems are already reachable: [https://do-webdev.de/projects/poems/](https://do-webdev.de/projects/poems/).
